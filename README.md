# Stack Overflow Classification with TensorFlow

## Project Description
This project is a machine learning model for classifying Stack Overflow questions into various topics. The model is trained on the Stack Overflow 16k dataset, which includes question texts and corresponding tags.

## Requirements
- Python version 3.12
- TensorFlow version 2.15

## Installation
1. Unzip the `stack_overflow_16k.tar.gz` folder.
2. Run the `Stackowerflow_ML.ipynb` notebook in your IDE. It is recommended to use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for convenience.

## Project Structure
- `Stackowerflow_ML.ipynb`: The main project notebook containing the code for training and testing the model.
- `stack_overflow_16k/`: Folder containing the Stack Overflow 16k dataset.

## Usage
1. Open the `Stackowerflow_ML.ipynb` file in your IDE.
2. Run the cells one by one, following the instructions in the notebook.
